<h1>Longtime Programming</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
Let's think for a moment about an ATM (automatic teller machine) program
where a user is presented with a menu screen asking if they'd like to deposit, withdraw
or exit. When the user chooses deposit or withdraw, they're taken to another screen where
their transaction is processed, then they click 'OK' button, and they return to the menu screeen.
They can do as many transactions as they want, until they choose exit from the menu, and their session ends.
</p>

<p>
We might write pseudocode for the software like this:
</p>

<pre>
transactionsDone = false

while(!transactionsDone)
{
	choice = showMenu()
	
	if(choice == deposit)
		runDepositScreen()
	else if(choice == withdraw)
		runWithdrawScreen()
	else if(choice == exit)
		transactionsDone = true
}
</pre>

<p>
The pseudocode makes sense and is understandable, but wait! We can't program the app in this way!
Why not? Well, because the deposit and withdrawal screen take a long time to execute. 
Our JavaScript programming language is based on the idea that each statement takes a very short time to execute and
then the program goes promptly to the next step.
</p>

<p>
That's where Longtime Programming comes in. Longtime programming is an attempt to make pseudocode like the above example
translate into real code as closely as possible.

<h2>ATM Demo</h2>

<p>
Here's an example of an ATM machine programmed with longtime programming:

The source code shows one while loop nested inside another, however the loops are implemented as an 
array of anonymous function definitions combined with special flags such as Stepper.STARTWHILE.
A simpler while loop demo is below, where the structure of the loop may be more easily seen:

<p>
"If" control structures are also implemented in the longtime library, to support cases where it's desired to conditionally
execute code:

Longtime programming has applications for animation, architecture, and services.
