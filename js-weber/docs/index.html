<h1>Longtime Programming</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
"Longtime" programming is an idea that came to mind to help with writing JavaScript programs
such as user interfaces, where a program follows an overall logical path, 
however long amounts of time elapse between the points in the program where control flow changes direction.
This Longtime programming demo is meant to be an exploration of a possible language feature,
and a proof of concept.
</p>

<p>
As an example application of Longtime programming, let's think for a moment about an 
ATM (automatic teller machine)
where a user is presented with a menu screen asking if they'd like to deposit, withdraw
or exit. When the user chooses deposit or withdraw, they're taken to another screen where
their transaction is processed, then they click an 'OK' button to return to the menu screen.
They can do as many transactions as they want, until they choose exit from the menu, and 
then their session ends. The program then waits for the next customer.
</p>

<p>
We might write pseudocode for the program like this:
</p>

<pre><code>

while(true) // loop for multiple customers
{
	transactionsDone = false

	while(!transactionsDone) // loop to do this customer's transactions
	{
		choice = showMenu()
		
		if(choice == deposit)
			runDepositScreen()
		else if(choice == withdraw)
			runWithdrawScreen()
		else if(choice == exit)
			transactionsDone = true
	}
}

</code></pre>

<p>
The pseudocode makes sense and is understandable, but wait! We can't program the app with code that resembles the pseudocode!
Why not? Because the deposit and withdrawal screen take a long time (many seconds) to execute, but our JavaScript programming
language is based on the idea that each statement takes a very short time to execute and then the program promptly goes to the next step.
For example, in JavaScript, the line where we call runDepositScreen() would execute, then a fraction of a second later it would return,
and control flow would loop, and the line where we call showMenu() would then execute, showing the menu screen before the user has had even
a second to interact with the deposit screen.
</p>

<p>
Longtime programming comes in as an attempt to make pseudocode like the above example translate into executable JavaScript code. 
The appeal of Longtime programming is that the pseudocode of our example is a very natural way to express the program.
Please understand that I have created a proof of concept, which functions
correctly however the JavaScript code is more cumbersome than the pseudocode as is expected in this first phase of development.
The next phase of development would be to create an elegant and concise language resembling the pseudocode that would cross compile
into JavaScript, or alternatively add a new language feature to JavaScript.

A simpler while loop demo is below, where the structure of the loop may be more easily seen:

Longtime programming potentially has applications for user interfaces, animation, service oriented architecture, and more.
